In this guide, you will learn how to get an existing server into Cordviews, from start to finish.

:::info
This guide assumes that you are a server administrator of the server you are trying to apply, with `ADMINISTRATOR` permission in Discord.
:::
:::warning
You will need an invite key in order to apply your server for Cordviews. If you don't have one, try searching for one, asking for one, or wait until the beta is over, which will be soon.
