Welcome to the Cordviews website! Let's take a deeper look on how this website was created.

## The Origin
It was just a regular day, not knowing what to do. I wanted to clear up some of my servers, since I was reaching the 100 servers limit, and something like 10 of them I own myself, but is not active. Many of those were ones that were scrapped, but I would still like to keep them as, sort of, memories.

Anyways, I might have cleared up too much, and I said to myself, why not create a new one?

Spoiler alert: I made Cordviews and I had to dedicate at least the next 3 months to it. It looks like [Sunrise to Sunset](https://www.sunrisetosunset.tk) isn't going to have a good time in the next 3 months. That is, if Cordviews is successful.

## A website!?
I have planned Cordviews to be a Discord-bot only, since I have probably near-zero experience of creating websites. If I would, I would need an API and a backend. So for now, I'll probably just stick with Discord bots for now.

## The technical bits
You might be wondering, Godder, where do you host these platforms? I host the <a class="highlight">@Cordviews</a> bot currently in [Techna Host](https://techna.xyz), but I would really like to move on to a free plan at one of these services, ranked from my personal favourite to worst:

* Oracle Cloud
* Google Cloud
* Amazon Web Services

It's not that I have a bad time at AWS, but it's just not right for me. Oh, and for Azure, I'm not eligible for the student plan, so, sucks to sucks.

If the bot gets over 10,000 servers, I *might* consider moving to a service that's not a free plan. But, that's a long way from now, and I'm probably not going to reach there anytime soon. But, as they say, a person could only hope.

Oh and, I host the website on Netlify. If that turns out to not go well, I'll go to GitHub Pages. The only reason I'm not using Vercel, which I strongly prefer over both of them, is because GitHub organization support requires a paid plan, and I don't want to spend money on Cordviews. Yet.
